          Happiness is something that people seek to find, yet what defines
          happiness can vary from one person to the next. Typically, happiness
          is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction,
          contentment, and fulfillment. While happiness has many different
          definitions, it is often described as involving positive emotions and
          life satisfaction. When most people talk about the true meaning of
          happiness, they might be talking about how they feel in the present
          moment or referring to a more general sense of how they feel about
          life overall. Because happiness tends to be such a broadly defined
          term, psychologists and other social scientists typically use the term
          'subjective well-being' when they talk about this emotional state.
          Just as it sounds, subjective well-being tends to focus on an
          individual's overall personal feelings about their life in the
          present.
